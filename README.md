# Wiki-Scrapping

This repo contains the code I used to scrap all the articles information from [this site](https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/). It was made mostly for learning purposes, but, the data aquired can be used to ilustrate and test some data visualization tools, NLP, machine learning, etc.  

At the end of the script, the data should be organized as a data-frame with column names:
* "nome"
* "genero"
* "sol"
* "asc"
* "lua"
* "bio"
* "events"
* "relationships"
* "sources"
* "categories"
