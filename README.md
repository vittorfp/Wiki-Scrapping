# Wiki-Scrapping

This repo contains the code I used to scrap all the articles information from the site [https://www.astro.com/astro-databank/]. It was made mostly for learning purposes, but, the data aquired can be used to ilustrate and test some data visualization tools, NLP, machine learning, etc.  

At the end of the script, the data should be organized as a data-frame with collum names:
* "nome"
* "genero"
* "sol"
* "asc"
* "lua"
* "bio"
* "events"
* "relationships"
* "sources"
* "categories" 

Feel free to make anything you want with this, but remember who did it (in the remote case it helps somebody).
